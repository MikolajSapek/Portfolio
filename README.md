## Design Philosophy

The website uses an elegant, luxurious color palette inspired by high-end photo albums:
- Clean whites and light grays as primary backgrounds
- Dark graphite and deep black for contrast
- Gold and silver accents
- Minimalist typography with Space Grotesk font
- Focus on letting photographs "pop" against clean backgrounds

## Browser Support

Modern browsers that support:
- ES6+ JavaScript
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
- GSAP ScrollTrigger

## Notes

- All photos are actual analog photography, not placeholders
- Images are organized by album in separate folders
- The site is designed to work offline (all assets are local)
- ScrollTrigger animations require JavaScript to be enabled
